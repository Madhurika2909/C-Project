# C-Project
Numerical Tic-Tac-Toe Game
This is a C program for a game similar to Tic Tac Toe where two players take turns to mark a grid with their symbol (X or O).<br> The program is modified to add an additional feature where players also place coins (1, 2, or 3) on the grid, and the <br>player with the highest coin value on a grid occupies it. The player who occupies a grid with the highest coin value on it <br>can lose the grid to another player who places a higher coin value on the same grid. The game continues until one player wins or there is a draw.
